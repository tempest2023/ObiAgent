## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage in Agent Flow

When a user asks: *"Create a financial report about OpenAI"*

1. The `WorkflowDesignerNode` analyzes the request
2. Designs a workflow using the financial research nodes
3. `WorkflowExecutorNode` executes the designed workflow
4. User receives a comprehensive financial report

### Advanced Usage Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Quick Company Assessment**
```python
# Set report_type to "executive_summary" for faster analysis
shared["report_type"] = "executive_summary"
```

**Scenario 2: Comparative Analysis**
```python
# Run workflow for multiple companies
companies = ["OpenAI", "Anthropic", "Cohere"]
for company in companies:
    shared["company_name"] = company
    # Execute workflow for each company
```

**Scenario 3: Risk-Focused Analysis**
```python
# Focus on risk assessment
shared["news_timeframe"] = "6 months"  # Recent news only
