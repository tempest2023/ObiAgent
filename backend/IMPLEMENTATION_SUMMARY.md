# PocketFlow General Agent System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Built

A sophisticated general agent system that can solve complex, vague user questions by dynamically designing and executing workflows. The system follows PocketFlow design patterns and includes learning capabilities, permission handling, and comprehensive monitoring.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### 1. **Node Registry System** (`utils/node_registry.py`)
- **Purpose**: Catalogs all available nodes with metadata
- **Features**:
  - Node categorization (search, analysis, booking, payment, etc.)
  - Permission levels (none, basic, sensitive, critical)
  - Input/output specifications
  - Example usage patterns
- **Nodes Available**: 12 nodes covering flight search, cost analysis, user interaction, permissions, etc.

### 2. **Workflow Store** (`utils/workflow_store.py`)
- **Purpose**: Persistent storage and retrieval of successful workflows
- **Features**:
  - Similarity-based workflow retrieval
  - Success rate tracking
  - Usage statistics
  - Automatic workflow optimization

### 3. **Permission Manager** (`utils/permission_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handles user permissions for sensitive operations
- **Features**:
  - Permission request creation and tracking
  - Timeout management
  - Multiple permission types (payment, booking, etc.)
  - User response handling

### 4. **Agent Nodes** (`nodes.py`)
- **WorkflowDesignerNode**: Analyzes questions and designs workflows using LLM
- **WorkflowExecutorNode**: Executes designed workflows dynamically
- **UserInteractionNode**: Manages user questions and responses
- **WorkflowOptimizerNode**: Analyzes results and suggests improvements

### 5. **Flow Design** (`flow.py`)
- **General Agent Flow**: Full-featured flow with optimization and user interaction
- **Simple Agent Flow**: Basic flow for straightforward questions
- **Legacy Chat Flow**: Backward compatibility

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Setup**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### 2. **Run the Server**
```bash
python server.py
```

### 3. **Access the Web Interface**
- Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
- Try example questions like:
  - "Help book a flight ticket from Los Angeles to Shanghai with high cost performance, preferably departing in the afternoon."
  - "Find me the best hotel deals in Tokyo for next month, budget around $200 per night."

### 4. **API Endpoints**
- **WebSocket**: `/api/v1/ws` - Real-time agent interaction
- **Nodes**: `/api/v1/nodes` - Get available nodes
- **Workflows**: `/api/v1/workflows` - Manage stored workflows
- **Permissions**: `/api/v1/permissions` - Handle permission requests

### 5. **Demo Scripts**
```bash
# Run the demo
python demo.py

# Run the test
python test_agent.py
```

## 🔧 Example Workflow Execution

### User Question
> "Help book a flight ticket from Los Angeles to Shanghai with high cost performance, preferably departing in the afternoon."

### What Happens

1. **WorkflowDesignerNode** analyzes the question:
   ```yaml
   workflow:
     name: Flight Booking Workflow
     nodes:
       - name: result_summarizer
         description: Present recommendations
   ```

2. **WorkflowExecutorNode** executes the workflow:
   - Searches for flights (mock implementation)
   - Analyzes costs and preferences
   - Generates recommendations

3. **WorkflowOptimizerNode** evaluates success

4. **Workflow Store** saves the successful workflow for future reuse

## 🧠 Learning Capabilities

### Workflow Learning
- Successful workflows are automatically saved
- Similar questions can reuse past workflow patterns
- Success rates are tracked and used for ranking

### Optimization
- Failed workflows trigger optimization analysis
- User feedback is incorporated into workflow improvements
- The system can redesign workflows based on issues

## 🔒 Security and Permissions

### Permission Levels
- **NONE**: No permission required
- **BASIC**: Simple confirmation
- **SENSITIVE**: Detailed review required
- **CRITICAL**: Explicit approval with details

### Sensitive Operations
- Payment processing
- Booking confirmations
- Data access
- System actions

## 📊 Monitoring and Statistics

The system provides comprehensive statistics:
- **Workflow Store**: Success rates, usage counts, node categories
- **Permission Manager**: Grant/deny rates, response times
- **Node Registry**: Available nodes by category

## 🛠️ Extending the System

### Adding New Nodes
1. Register in `utils/node_registry.py`:
   ```python
   node_registry.register_node(NodeMetadata(
       name="custom_node",
       description="Description of what this node does",
       category=NodeCategory.ANALYSIS,
       permission_level=PermissionLevel.NONE,
       inputs=["input1", "input2"],
       outputs=["output1"],
       examples=[{"input1": "example", "output1": "result"}]
   ))
   ```

2. Implement in `WorkflowExecutorNode._execute_node()`

### Adding New Flows
Create new flow functions in `flow.py` and add endpoints in `server.py`
